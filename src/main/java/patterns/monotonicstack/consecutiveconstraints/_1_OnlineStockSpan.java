/**
 * The **Stock Span Problem** is a financial problem that calculates the span
 * of a stockâ€™s price for a given day.
 *
 * <p>
 * The **span of a stock's price on a given day** is defined as the maximum
 * number of consecutive days (up to the current day) the price has been
 * **less than or equal to the current price**. This includes the current day itself.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
 * Given a stream of daily stock prices, find the stock span for each day.
 *
 * <h3>Example:</h3>
 * <pre>
 *  Input:  [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]
 *  Output: [1,   1,  1,  2,  1,  4,  6]
 *  </pre>
