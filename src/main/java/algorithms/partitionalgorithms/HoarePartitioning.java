/**
 * Partitions an array using the Hoare partitioning scheme.
 * This algorithm selects a pivot (often the first element in the array)
 * and rearranges elements around the pivot as follows:
 * - Elements less than the pivot are moved to the left side.
 * - Elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right side.
 * <p>
 * Unlike Lomuto's partitioning, Hoareâ€™s partitioning uses two pointers moving
 * from the ends of the array toward the center. The pointers stop when they find
 * elements that are on the wrong side of the pivot, and these elements are then swapped.
 * This approach requires fewer swaps on average, making it more efficient for arrays with
 * many duplicate values. However, the pivot does not necessarily end up at a fixed
 * position after partitioning, as it would with Lomuto's scheme.
 * <p>
 * After partitioning:
 * - The array is divided into two sections where elements on the left are less than
 * or equal to the pivot, and elements on the right are greater than or equal to the pivot.
 * - The returned partition index does not guarantee that the pivot itself is at this index;
 * rather, it marks the boundary between the two partitions.
 * <p>
 * This method is commonly used in optimized implementations of Quicksort.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Original array: [14, 5, 20, 4, 2, 54, 20, 87, 98, 3, 10, 32]
 * Partition index: 4
 * After partitioning: [10, 5, 3, 4, 2, 54, 20, 87, 98, 20, 14, 32]
 * <p>
 * Explanation:
 * - Elements to the left of index 4 are less than or equal to the pivot (14),
 * while elements to the right are greater than or equal to it.
 * - The pivot itself may not be at the partition index.
