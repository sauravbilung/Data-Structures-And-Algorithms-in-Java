Stable sorting algorithms :
A stable sorting algorithm preserves the relative order of equal elements from the original input in the sorted output.

üîÅ Common Stable Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
TimSort (used in Java, Python)
counting sort

‚ö†Ô∏è Unstable Sorting Algorithms:
Selection Sort
Quick Sort (standard version)
Heap Sort

Counting sort :

Counting Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by counting the number of occurrences of each element and using that count to place elements in the correct position.
‚úÖ Best when: The range of input data (i.e., max-min) is not too large.
